                <h1>Stijn - Vocals</h1>
                <p>
                    With a deep, commanding voice and an emotion-first delivery, Stijn brings every line to life, whether it’s a quiet confession or a full-throttle roar. As the band’s lyricist, he shapes the stories at the heart of the music, and on stage he turns them into something you feel, not just hear. Intense, magnetic, and impossible to ignore.

                <h1>Maxim - Drums</h1>
                <p>
                    Maxim is the engine behind the band: high-energy, razor-tight drumming that drives every song forward without ever losing control. Off the kit, he’s also the visual mind of the band, creating most of the artwork and shaping the look that comes with the sound. And every now and then, he steps into the writing too, adding lyrics that hit just as hard as his rhythms.

            <div class="lineup-intro-text">
                <h1>Emiel - Rhythm Guitar</h1>
                <p>
                    The youngest in the band, Emiel brings a raw edge that keeps everything loud, gritty, and alive. His rhythm work is the spark that turns riffs into full-on chaos, and his energy on stage is impossible to miss. Offstage, he’s the one keeping the band connected and active online, running most of the social media. Loud, fearless, and very likely the crowd favorite.

                <h1>Arno - Bass</h1>
                <p>
                    Arno, also known as Mister Brar Brar, is easily the loudest force in the band. His bass lines hit hard, stay tight, and keep everything grounded while still shaking the foundations as the chaos rages above. And if you’re a fan of bass solos… don’t worry, he’ll deliver.

                <h1>Jonas - Lead Guitar</h1>
                <p>
                    The newest addition to the lineup, Jonas has quickly become a key part of the band’s creative core. A multi-instrumentalist and major contributor to the songwriting, he helps shape the sound both on and off the stage, handling music production duties and constantly pushing new ideas forward. Expect atmospheric lead lines, explosive solos, and waves of gritty tone with a style that’s unmistakably his own.
